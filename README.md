# Loader View for Android
## What It Is
Provide both TextView and ImageView the ability to show shimmer (animation loader) before any text or image is shown. Useful when waiting for data to be loaded from the network. Example below

## Features / Usage

1. Loader View for TextView defined in layout XML
    ```xml
    <com.elyeproj.loaderviewlibrary.LoaderTextView
         android:layout_width="match_parent"
         android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
    ```

2. Loader View for ImageView defined in layout XML
    ```xml
    <com.elyeproj.loaderviewlibrary.LoaderImageView
         android:layout_width="100dp"
         android:layout_height="100dp" />
    ```

3. Define the % length of the TextView that shows the loading animation with `length_weight`
    ```xml
    <com.elyeproj.loaderviewlibrary.LoaderTextView
         android:layout_width="match_parent"
         android:layout_height="wrap_content"
         app:length_weight="0.4" />
    ```

3. Setting the Text Style as BOLD would darken the loading shimmer

4. Other feature of TextView and ImageView is still applicable.
